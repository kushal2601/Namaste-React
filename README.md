Difference between a Library and a framework?
Best analogy for this is an Ikea furniture which represents a library 
it's like a piece of utility that somebody has written and kept at a store and we have the freedom of either chosing it or rejecting it
whereas framework is like a flats wherin the whole layout is already made and you cannot change the structuring of the house that you want to build.

What is CDN? Why do we use it ?
CDN is an abbrevation for content delivery network which means having various servers so that the data can be rendered in faster and secured way .
We use it to inject some piece of code available somewhere on the internet

Difference between React and ReactDOM?
React is concerned with creating components and all the core concepts of the React 
whereas ReactDOM is concerned with putting the code onto the DOM inside the website which means various other things might be needed to render things on an normal mobile application.

mostly lot of things that we need during development 
for example the comments for the code readability is not required for production which is what dealed during production 

Diff b/w async and defer?
